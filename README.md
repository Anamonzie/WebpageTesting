# Webpage Testing Current Tasks

## Corrections:

- Need to get rid of the static in ConfigurationLoader
- Combine configurationLoader and Manager, but be sure that configuraiton is read only once
- Create factories as singletons

- Have all code in one solution, under different projects
- To move project to the one solution, polish code for example of customAssertyions to have test form

## Additional tasks:

- configure the repository to have branch and pull requests, and having at least one reviewer
- to define list of test categories, mark tests with test categories
- update workflow dispatcher to run tests with different categories
- if we need to call base implementation with adding logging on top of this, how it can be implemented in c#
- type casting(main ways and differences)

- allure serve - how it works
- Allure attributes - to investigate
- Allure side-menu sections (overview, categories, suities, timelines, behaviours, packages)
